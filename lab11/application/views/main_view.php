  <p>
    I've always been drawn to the overlap between <strong>design</strong> and <strong>development</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My <strong>skills</strong> are broad: from UX to design, front-end to back-end development. I enjoy each aspect,
    and love to build sites from start to finish, do branding and collateral from time to time.
